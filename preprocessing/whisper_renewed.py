"""
This script uses whisper_timestamped in order to generate small segments together
with their corresponding text. 
Complete songs will be cut into small pieces and their corresponding text will be saved 
as a txt file with the same name.
The script was altered a couple of times to achieve the best possible result. 
We increased the required segment length to at least four seconds and tried to avoid hard cuts
to make the next steps (the labelling) as good as possible
